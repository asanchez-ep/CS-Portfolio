                 <p> Vindinium is known as an "Artificial Intelligence programming challenge".
                     Essentially, people can code bots in any language they like so that they can fight other 
                     people's AI bots in Vindinium. There are a total of four bots allowed in the arena at a time. Bots are generally trying to have the greatest possesion of Gold and staying alive. The only way
                     a bot can have possession of Gold is by going to the mines or stealing it from other bots. For the bot to keep its health stable they generally
                     have to go to the taverns to recharge.
                     The winner of a tournamentis determined by what bot 

                     has the greatest ownership of Gold at the end of the 1200 turns available.                
                </p>

                 Asanz is the name of the bot I created, and I chose to not make my bot super agressive (I think). 
                 My bot has three functions: attacking other bots that have more than 1 mine, going to 
                 the nearest tavern when its health is lower than 40 or when it has all the mines, and acquring any free mines.

                    <p>These are the tasks that my bot can take on depending on its current situation.</p>

                    <p>In this section you can find the JavaScript code for how my bot goes about certain decisions.
                       This piece of code represents HOW my bot will do its tasks.
